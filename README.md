Developed a stock market prediction model using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network with Keras and TensorFlow.

Utilized Python libraries such as yfinance to retrieve historical stock data and scikit-learn for data preprocessing, including data normalization and train-test splitting.

Designed and trained a deep learning model with multiple LSTM and Dropout layers to forecast future stock prices, achieving a low mean squared error.

Built an interactive web application using the Streamlit framework, allowing users to input any stock ticker symbol and visualize historical data, moving averages (MA50, MA100, MA200), and the model's price predictions.

Successfully integrated the trained model into the web application, demonstrating an end-to-end machine learning project from data acquisition and model development to deployment.
